Lucky improves your Defense to Area of Effect attacks and grants you resistance to Defense DeBuffs. Lucky also grants you minor Damage Resistance to all damage except Toxic and Psionic. This Damage Resistance is only available as you lose Health but it improves as your HP declines. This power is always on, and permanently increases your chance to evade area effects and cone shaped attacks.","display_short_help":"Auto: Self +DEF(vs. AoE), Res(DeBuff DEF), Res(All DMG, Special)","display_info":{"Power Type":"Auto","Effect Area":"Single Target","Available Level":"28","Target Type":"Self"},"enhancements_allowed":["Enhance Defense"],"enhancement_set_categories_allowed":["Defense Sets"],"available_at_level":28,"auto_issue":false,"power_type":"Auto","accuracy":1.0,"effect_area":{"area":"SingleTarget"},"target_type_tags":["Self","Alive","Dead"],"display_target_type":"Self","target_auto_hit_tags":[["Self","Alive","Dead"]],"display_target_auto_hit":["Self"],"requires_line_of_sight":true,"modes_disallowed":["Disable_All"],"activate":{"cast_time":0.0,"animation_time":1.17,"animation_time_before_hit":0.5,"recharge_time":0.0,"auto_cast_interval":2.0,"endurance_cost":0.0},"effect_groups":[{"visible_in_info_window":true,"chance_percent":100.0,"effects":[{"attributes":["Area_Def"],"applies_to":"CurrentValue","application_type":"OnTick","tick_chance_percent":100.0,"target_type":"Self","magnitude":1.0,"duration":"InSeconds","duration_seconds":2.5,"flags":["IgnoreResistance","CombatModMagnitude"],"stacking":{"behavior":"Replace","by_caster":true},"scaled":[{"archetype":"Brute","percent":5.63,"display_info":["5.63% strength to AoE for 2.5s on self","Unresistable"],"base_value":0.075,"scale":0.75}]},{"attributes":["Defense"],"applies_to":"Resistance","application_type":"OnTick","tick_chance_percent":100.0,"target_type":"Self","magnitude":1.0,"duration":"InSeconds","duration_seconds":2.5,"flags":["IgnoreResistance","CombatModMagnitude"],"stacking":{"behavior":"Replace","by_caster":true},"scaled":[{"archetype":"Brute","percent":6.92,"display_info":["6.92% resistance to defense debuff for 2.5s on self","Unresistable"],"base_value":0.346,"scale":0.2}]},{"attributes":["Smashing_Dmg","Lethal_Dmg","Fire_Dmg","Cold_Dmg","Energy_Dmg","Negative_Energy_Dmg"],"applies_to":"Resistance","application_type":"OnTick","tick_chance_percent":100.0,"target_type":"Self","magnitude":1.0,"magnitude_expression":"(minmax((60 - source>kHitPoints%), 0, 100) / 60) * 0.2","duration":"InSeconds","duration_seconds":2.5,"flags":["IgnoreStrength","IgnoreResistance","CombatModMagnitude"],"stacking":{"behavior":"Replace","by_caster":true},"scaled":[{"archetype":"Brute","percent":0.0,"display_info":["0.00% resistance to smashing damage, lethal damage, fire damage, cold damage, energy damage, negative energy damage for 2.5s on self","Ignores buffs and enhancements","Unresistable"],"base_value":1.0,"scale":0.0}]}]}]},{"name":"Brute_Defense.Super_Reflexes.Quickness","display_name":"Quickness","icon":"https://reborn-team.github.io/PowersAPI/assets/powers/73/superreflexes_quickness.png","display_help":"Your Quick reflexes allow you to move faster than normal, as well as resist slow effects.
